## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm HonzÃ­k, a software engineering student at the University of Waterloo interested in integrated software engineering for robotics applications. I've worked with control theory concepts, such as state-space control, AprilTag localization, and PID loops, and collaborative tools like Github Actions, Git, and Gantt charts. In high school, I organized weekly standups, presented to local industry leaders, and participated in various community outreach events. At University, I'm an Autonomy Project Manager at [WARG](https://www.uwarg.com/) and am currently working on [BARS](https://github.com/honzikschenk/BARS), my bipedal robot! I love backpacking, mountain biking, and rock climbing in my free time.
